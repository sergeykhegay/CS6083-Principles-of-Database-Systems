Just put everything in your Apache serving folder. And you are good to go.

NOTE:
1. Most likely you will have to change db connection settings in utils.php:get_db_connection().
2. PostgreSQL db is required.
3. The schema modified for the PostgreSQL is available in
   marketplace_pg_schema.txt

Good luck!
